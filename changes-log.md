## July 25, 2025 - Project Structure Cleanup

1. **Simplified project structure for better maintainability**
   - Organized files into logical directories at the root level:
     - `controllers`: Controller logic for handling API requests
     - `routes`: API route definitions and endpoint handlers
     - `processors`: Data processing scripts and utilities
   - Removed unnecessary nesting and redundant files

2. **Implemented MVC architecture**
   - Separated concerns between routes and controllers
   - Created proper controller classes for API and webhook endpoints
   - Standardized error handling and response formats

3. **Updated cleanAndProcessData.js to handle real n8n output**
   - Modified extraction logic to properly parse the provided sample output format
   - Added support for handling both array and object formats from n8n
   - Improved port parsing with proper type conversion

4. **Ensured proper file referencing**
   - Updated all import paths to use the new flat structure
   - Fixed npm script paths for process-data and clean-data commands

## July 25, 2025 - Phase 5: LLM Report Generation (Groq)

1. **Created Groq API integration service**
   - Created `groqService.js` for interacting with the Groq LLM API
   - Implemented method to generate cybersecurity reports from scan data
   - Set up intelligent prompt construction based on scan results

2. **Implemented report generation workflow**
   - Created `generateReport.js` script to automate report generation
   - Added functionality to find scan results without reports
   - Implemented database integration to save generated reports

3. **Added manual report generation API endpoint**
   - Created ReportController with report generation functionality
   - Added `/api/generate-reports` endpoint for manual triggering
   - Updated processor workflow to include report generation step

4. **Updated project scripts**
   - Added `generate-reports` script for easy report generation
   - Updated main processor workflow to include report generation
   - Ensured proper integration with existing data processing flow

## July 25, 2025 - Phase 6: Real-Time Status Updates & Automation

1. **Implemented State Machine for Scan Workflow**
   - Created `stateMachine.js` service for managing scan workflow states
   - Defined clear state transitions: `pending` → `scanning` → `processing` → `generating_report` → `completed`
   - Added proper error states and recovery mechanisms
   - Implemented event emitter for state change notifications

2. **Added WebSocket Support**
   - Implemented WebSocket server using Socket.IO
   - Created `webSocketService.js` for real-time status updates

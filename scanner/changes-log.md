# NetSage Scanner Changes Log

This document tracks all changes made to the NetSage scanner as part of the enhancement plan.

## [2025-07-29] Phase 1, Step 1: Output Format Standardization

### Changes:
- Modified `formatResultsForBackend` function in `index.js` to ensure consistent output format
- Added `scan_metadata` section to include information about:
  - Target URL, hostname, and protocol
  - Which scan techniques were used (port scan, HTTP analysis, vulnerability scan)
- Standardized `http_security` section to always be present with default values when data is unavailable
- Enhanced `scan_data` handling:
  - Ensured `product` field is always included in scan_data entries
  - Added fallback entry when no services are detected
  - Combined port scan and HTTP information more intelligently
- Standardized vulnerability output:
  - Always include all severity levels in summary with zero counts for missing levels
  - Added consistent field defaults for vulnerability findings
  - Ensured all vulnerabilities have proper formatting

### Expected Results:
- Uniform JSON structure in all scan outputs regardless of target
- More comprehensive metadata about the scan
- Better handling of edge cases when scans return limited information
- More consistent vulnerability reporting

## [2025-07-29] Phase 1, Step 2: Error Handling & Reporting

### Changes:
- Added error classification system in `Scanner` class:
  - Created `classifyError` method to standardize error types
  - Added detection for common error patterns (timeouts, connection issues, firewalls, etc.)
- Enhanced `scan` method error reporting:
  - Added `scan_status` object to track success/failure of each scan component
  - Preserved original errors while adding more detailed information
  - Added timestamps to error objects
- Modified `scanPorts` method:
  - Changed timeout handling to properly reject with informative error
  - Added error classification for Nmap-specific issues
  - Enhanced error objects with type information
- Updated `formatResultsForBackend` function:
  - Included errors section in standard output
  - Added scan_status to metadata
  - Ensured errors are properly formatted in output

### Expected Results:
- Better visibility into why scans fail or return limited results
- Ability to distinguish between "no vulnerabilities found" and "scan was blocked"
- More detailed error reporting for debugging and monitoring
- Clear indication of which scan components succeeded/failed
- Standardized error types to enable better error handling by client applications

## [2025-07-29] Phase 1, Step 3: Timeout Optimization

### Changes:
- Implemented configurable timeouts through environment variables:
  - Added separate timeout settings for port scanning, HTTP analysis, and Nuclei scanning
  - Added overall scan timeout to prevent scans from running too long
  - Created `.env.example` file demonstrating timeout configuration options
- Added adaptive timeout system based on target response:
  - Added initial ping check to categorize targets as 'responsive', 'normal', or 'slow'
  - Implemented dynamic timeout multipliers based on target category
  - Created `calculateAdaptiveTimeout` method to adjust timeouts during scan
- Enhanced Nmap scan options for better timeout handling:
  - Added `--host-timeout` parameter based on adaptive timeouts
  - Added `--max-retries` parameter to limit retries on unresponsive ports
  - Added timing template selection based on target response category
- Improved HTTP header analysis with adaptive timeouts:
  - Added better HTTP headers to avoid detection as a scanner
  - Implemented adaptive timeout calculation for HTTP requests
- Enhanced Nuclei scanning with better timeout management:
  - Implemented dynamic timeout calculation based on remaining overall time
  - Added better error handling for timeout situations
  - Added rate limiting and concurrency options for more reliable scans

### Expected Results:
- More reliable scanning against slow or protected targets
- Better scan completion rates with optimized timeouts
- Reduced false negatives from premature scan termination
- More intelligent resource usage based on target response characteristics
- Clearer reporting of timeout-related issues

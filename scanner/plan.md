# NetSage Scanner Enhancement Plan

This document outlines the phased approach to enhance the NetSage scanner's capabilities, focusing on both uniform output format and improved scan results against protected targets.

## Phase 1: Output Standardization & Timeout Optimization

### Step 1: Standardize Output Format
- Modify `formatResultsForBackend` function to include consistent sections in all outputs
- Add `http_security` section with null values when unavailable
- Add `product` field to scan_data entries consistently
- Add scan metadata section with information about what scan techniques were used

### Step 2: Improve Error Handling & Reporting
- Add error fields for each scan component (ports, HTTP, nuclei)
- Distinguish between "no results found" and "scan blocked/failed"
- Add error type classification (firewall block, timeout, connection refused)
- Include error information in output rather than suppressing errors

### Step 3: Optimize Timeouts
- Increase Nuclei scan timeout from 30s to at least 120s
- Implement adaptive timeouts based on target response time
- Add configurable timeout parameters in environment variables
- Add proper timeout handling for all scan components

## Phase 2: Enhanced Port Scanning Techniques

### Step 1: Implement Advanced Nmap Options
- Add SYN stealth scan options (`-sS`)
- Add timing options for less detectable scans (`-T2` or `-T3`)
- Implement service scan optimizations (`--host-timeout`, `--max-retries`)
- Add script scanning for service enumeration (`--script=banner,http-headers`)

### Step 2: Add Multi-strategy Scanning
- Implement fallback scan strategies when initial scan fails
- Start with less aggressive scan, escalate if no results
- Add TCP connect scan as fallback for SYN scan
- Add UDP scanning for comprehensive service detection

### Step 3: Improve Port Detection Logic
- Better extract port information from URLs
- Implement service-to-port mapping when direct detection fails
- Add common port checking for standard services
- Add banner grabbing through established connections

## Phase 3: Nuclei Enhancement

### Step 1: Optimize Nuclei Configuration
- Increase scan timeout to 600s minimum
- Implement rate limiting (`-rate-limit` parameter)
- Add retry mechanism for failed template executions
- Configure proper template selection based on target type

### Step 2: Enhance Template Usage
- Add comprehensive template selection
- Implement severity filtering options
- Add custom templates for common vulnerabilities
- Include templates for WAF detection and evasion

### Step 3: Improve Nuclei Process Handling
- Better handle Nuclei output parsing
- Implement proper error and signal handling
- Add progress tracking during long scans
- Optimize command-line parameters for Windows environments

## Phase 4: Advanced Evasion & Detection Techniques

### Step 1: Add Evasion Techniques
- Implement IP fragmentation options (`-f` in Nmap)
- Add decoy scan capabilities (`-D` parameter)
- Implement source port manipulation (`--source-port`)
- Add randomized scan order (`--randomize-hosts`)

### Step 2: Implement Alternative Detection Methods
- Add passive service detection when active scanning fails
- Implement TLS/SSL certificate analysis
- Add HTTP response fingerprinting
- Implement JavaScript/CSS fingerprinting for technology detection

### Step 3: Add Proxy Support
- Implement scanning through proxies to avoid blocks
- Add user-agent rotation
- Implement connection pooling for more efficient scanning
- Add support for scanning through TOR (optional)

## Phase 5: Scan Process Optimization

### Step 1: Implement Multi-stage Scanning
- Create progressive scan pipeline with increasing intensity
- Track scan success/failure and adapt strategy
- Implement service-specific scanning techniques
- Add intelligent retry logic based on error types

### Step 2: Add Results Enrichment
- Enhance vulnerability information with CVE details
- Add exploit availability information
- Implement severity scoring and prioritization
- Add remediation suggestions based on findings

### Step 3: Performance Optimization
- Implement parallel scanning where appropriate
- Add caching for common lookup operations
- Optimize resource usage for concurrent scans
- Implement graceful degradation for overloaded systems

## Phase 6: Advanced Features

### Step 1: Add Authentication Support
- Implement authenticated scanning capabilities
- Add session handling for web applications
- Support for API authentication
- Add cookie/token management

### Step 2: Add Custom Scan Profiles
- Create different scan profiles (quick, standard, thorough)
- Implement target type detection for automatic profile selection
- Add configuration options for scan intensity
- Implement scheduled scanning

### Step 3: Reporting Enhancements
- Add trend analysis for recurring scans
- Implement comparison with previous scan results
- Add visual representation options for findings
- Create exportable comprehensive reports

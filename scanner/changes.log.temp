  - Confirmed callback URL compatibility with backend webhook controller
- Enhanced error handling for result delivery:
  - Added detailed logging of response status from callback endpoint
  - Improved error messages for troubleshooting integration issues

## 2025-07-26: Frontend Integration Fixes

- Updated backend to properly communicate with the scanner:
  - Modified backend's `.env` file to point N8N_WEBHOOK_URL to scanner's endpoint (http://localhost:3001/scan)
  - Updated `scanController.js` to use axios instead of node-fetch
  - Changed API call implementation to match scanner's expected request format
  - Updated logging messages to reference scanner instead of n8n
- Installed axios in the backend for reliable API communication

- Improved reliability of the full integration workflow
- Tested end-to-end functionality from frontend to scanner to backend

## 2025-07-26: Data Format Alignment

- Updated scanner output format to match the expected structure in docs/output.json:
  - Changed from object structure with scan_data array to direct array format
  - Added request_id as first element in the array
  - Ensured port information format matches expected structure
  - Added HTTP header information in the expected format
- Updated webhook controller to accept both old and new data formats
- Fixed data extraction in the backend processing pipeline
- Improved compatibility between scanner and backend data processing

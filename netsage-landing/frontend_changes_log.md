# Frontend Changes Log

This document tracks all changes made during the integration of the NetSage frontend with the backend services.

## Setup (Date: July 26, 2025)

- Created implementation plan
- Created changes log

## Step 1: Setup Dependencies

**Status: Completed** (July 26, 2025)

### Changes Made:
- Installed Socket.IO client: `socket.io-client@4.8.1`
- Installed file-saver: `file-saver@2.0.5`
- Installed type definitions: `@types/file-saver@2.0.7`

## Step 2: Create API Service Layer

**Status: Completed** (July 26, 2025)

### Changes Made:
- Created `services/api.ts` file with the following:
  - API endpoint functions:
    - `submitScan()` - for submitting new scan requests
    - `getScanStatus()` - for checking scan status
    - `getScanReport()` - for retrieving scan reports
    - `retryScan()` - for retrying failed scans
  - Type definitions for API responses and scan data
  - Error handling with custom `ApiError` class
  - Helper function `generateReportFilename()` for creating download filenames

## Step 3-6: UI Integration and Mock Implementation

**Status: Completed** (July 26, 2025)

### Changes Made:
- Modified `app/page.tsx` to implement a fully functional UI with mock data:
  - Added state management for form input, scan progress, and reporting
  - Integrated WebSocket status indicator with mock connection states
  - Implemented toast notification system for status updates
  - Added ScanProgressModal with simulated progress updates
  - Added Report modal with ReportPreview and ReportActions
  - Implemented form validation and submission handling
  - Added simulated scan progress with step transitions
  - Implemented mock report generation and display

### Implementation Details:
- UI components are fully connected with local state management
- Created mock data flow that simulates backend interaction:
  - Form validation and submission
  - WebSocket connection status changes
  - Scan progress updates with appropriate step transitions
  - Report generation and display
- All interactive elements are functional (buttons, form inputs, modals)
- Toast notifications appear for various status updates

## Step 7: Replace Mock Implementation with Real Backend Integration

**Status: Completed** (July 26, 2025)

### Changes Made:
- Created `contexts/WebSocketContext.tsx` with the following features:
  - Socket.IO connection to backend with automatic reconnection
  - Connection status tracking and reporting
  - Scan update subscription mechanism
  - Custom hooks for components to use WebSocket features
  - Error handling and disconnection management

- Created `contexts/ScanContext.tsx` with the following features:
  - Complete scan state management
  - API integration for all scan operations (submit, retry, status, report)
  - Real-time progress tracking via WebSockets
  - Fallback polling when WebSockets are disconnected
  - Comprehensive error handling

- Updated `app/layout.tsx` to include context providers:
  - Added ThemeProvider, WebSocketProvider, and ScanProvider
  - Added Sonner toast component for notifications

- Updated `app/page.tsx` to use real backend:
  - Replaced mock implementations with context hooks
  - Connected form submission to real API
  - Implemented real-time progress tracking
  - Updated report display to work with actual backend data
  - Added proper error handling with toast notifications
  - Maintained the same UI structure while replacing mock functionality

### Implementation Details:
- WebSocketContext provides real-time connection status and events from the backend
- ScanContext manages the entire scan lifecycle with the backend
- When WebSocket connection fails, the system falls back to polling
- Toast notifications now reflect actual backend events
- Progress modal shows real-time scan progress from backend
- Report modal displays actual scan results from the backend API
- Error states are properly handled and displayed to the user

### Hydration Error and React Rendering Fixes (July 26, 2025):
- Restructured the application layout to properly handle client-side context providers
- Created separate `providers.tsx` with 'use client' directive to prevent hydration mismatches
- Updated WebSocketContext to safely handle server-side rendering
- Added client-side detection for Socket.IO initialization
- Fixed hydration mismatch by adding a client-side mounting check in Providers component
- Added proper cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks in WebSocket subscriptions
- Fixed "Maximum update depth exceeded" error by restructuring effect dependencies
- Improved scan subscription handling to prevent circular updates
- Enhanced WebSocket event handling with proper event isolation
- Resolved dependency management issues in React hooks

## Step 8: Implement Utilities

**Status: Not Started**

### Planned Changes:
- Create utility functions for report downloads
- Add state mapping utilities

## Step 9: Testing

**Status: Not Started**

### Planned Tests:
- WebSocket connection tests
- Scan submission flow tests
- Report retrieval tests
- Error handling tests
- Download functionality tests

## Step 10: Performance Optimization

**Status: Not Started**

### Planned Changes:
- Add memoization where needed
- Optimize subscription management
- Add loading states

## Step 11: Optional Enhancements

**Status: Not Started**

### Potential Changes:
- Add scan history tracking
- Implement shareable reports
- Add offline support

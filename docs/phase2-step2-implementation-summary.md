# Phase 2, Step 2 Implementation Summary: Multi-strategy Scanning

## Overview
We've successfully implemented multi-strategy scanning with fallback mechanisms and UDP scanning for more comprehensive service detection. The enhancements allow NetSage to adapt to different network security scenarios and discover a broader range of services.

## Key Changes

### 1. TCP Connect Scan Fallback
- Added TCP connect scan as a fallback method when SYN scans fail or are blocked
- Implemented through the `tcpScanMethod` option in the `scanPorts` method
- Connect scans are more likely to succeed in environments with certain types of firewalls

### 2. UDP Port Scanning
- Added comprehensive UDP scanning capability to detect UDP-based services
- Created a dedicated `scanUdpPorts` method with optimized settings for UDP
- Configured common UDP ports like DNS (53), DHCP (67/68), NTP (123), NetBIOS (137-139), SNMP (161/162)
- Made UDP scanning configurable via the `enableUdpScan` option

### 3. Progressive Scan Strategy Escalation
- Implemented a tiered scanning approach that starts with standard scans and escalates to more intensive methods
- Created a multi-stage fallback system:
  1. Start with standard SYN scan
  2. Fallback to script-enhanced scan if no results
  3. Try TCP connect scan if still no results
  4. Attempt quick scan as a last resort
  5. Supplement with UDP scanning when appropriate

### 4. Enhanced Result Collection and Merging
- Improved the scan result collection process to merge findings from multiple scan methods
- Added tracking of scan success/failure per method
- Consolidated port results from different scan approaches into a unified format

## Benefits
- More reliable scanning against a variety of target types
- Better results against hosts protected by firewalls or security appliances
- Detection of UDP services that would be missed by TCP-only scans
- Intelligent adaptation to different target environments

## Next Steps
The next phase will focus on implementing Phase 2, Step 3: Improved Port Detection Logic, which will further enhance our ability to identify services on non-standard ports and extract more detailed information from the scanned ports.
